dpkg - package manager for Debian 
dpkg is a tool to install, build, remove and manage Debian packages. The primary and more user-friendly front-end for 
dpkg is aptitude. dpkg itself is  controlled entirely via command line parameters, which consist of exactly one action 
and zero or more options. The action-parameter tells dpkg what to do and options control the behavior of the action in 
some way. dpkg can also be used as a front-end to dpkg-deb and dpkg-query. The list of supported actions can be found 
later on in the ACTIONS section. If any  such  action  is encountered dpkg just runs dpkg-deb or dpkg-query with the 
parameters given to it, but no specific options are currently passed to them, to use any such option the back-ends need 
to be called directly.

apt- apt provides a high-level commandline interface for the package management system. 
It is intended as an end user interface and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default 
compared to more specialized APT tools like apt-get(8) and apt-cache(8).
