General Installation Considerations:
-------------------------------------
There are three main fields you can use PHP. 
a. Websites and web applications (server-side scripting)
b. Command line scripting
c. Desktop (GUI) applications
For the first and most common form, you need three things: PHP itself, a web server and a web browser. In case 
of setting up the server and PHP on your own, you have two choices for the method of connecting PHP to the server. 

For many servers PHP has a direct module interface (also called SAPI). These servers include Apache, Microsoft 
Internet Information Server (MS-IIS), Netscape and iPlanet servers. Many other servers have support for ISAPI, 
the Microsoft module interface (OmniHTTPd for example). 
If PHP has no module support for your web server, you can always use it as a CGI or FastCGI processor. This means 
you set up your server to use the CGI executable of PHP to process all PHP file requests on the server.

If you are also interested in using PHP for command line scripting (e.g. write scripts autogenerating some images 
for you offline, or processing text files depending on some arguments you pass to them), you always need the command 
line executable. For more information, read the section about writing command line PHP applications. 
In this case, you need no server and no browser.

With PHP you can also write desktop GUI applications using the PHP-GTK extension. 
This is a completely different approach than writing web pages, as you do not output any HTML, but manage windows 
and objects within them. For more information about PHP-GTK, please Â» visit the site dedicated to this extension. 
PHP-GTK is not included in the official PHP distribution.

Herein dealing with setting up PHP for web servers on Unix and Windows with server module interfaces and CGI 
executables. You will also find information on the command line executable in the following sections.
